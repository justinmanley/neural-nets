An implementation in Haskell of a basic neural network framework for practical problem solving.

My contribution to this problem is the module JustinNTest, which implements an algorithm for training a basic 
single-layer neural network.  This kind of neural network is appropriate for solving simple classification
problems (i.e. is this language English, French, German, or Spanish?)
